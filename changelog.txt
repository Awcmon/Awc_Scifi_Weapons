I started one too late. Added 03/11/12

From the original:
-Re-vamped whole base
	-Made easier to read
	-Made simpler
	-More organized

-Re-vamped the weapons
	-To fit the new base.

-Other crap that I can't remember

-Tried making two experimental weapons
	-Gatling SMG (Barrel refused to spin)
	-Handheld radar (So many things wrong with it... Well, tbh, it just wouldn't scan..)

-Added two new weapons
	-Cloaking SMG
	-AK47

-Made a 1337 crosshair system for guns without any other aiming system
	-Works like Mad Cows-- Aimpos, not center of screen. Viewpunch makes it have a purpose, and the AK47 tests that.

-Updated invis SMG so it actually cloaks you. BFG made it first when he haxxed in somebody else's code into mine.
